              <h3>Birthday Paradox Simulation</h3>
              <p><strong>What is the Birthday Paradox?</strong></p>
              <p>The Birthday Paradox is a probability concept that explores how likely it is for two or more people in a group to share the same birthday. At first, it might seem like this would only happen in very large groups, but in reality, the chances increase much faster than most people expect. This is because each person’s birthday is compared to everyone else’s in the group, creating many opportunities for a match. The paradox is commonly used in fields like cryptography and data science, where understanding probabilities and patterns is important.</p>
              <p><strong>What Does This Project Do?</strong></p>
              <p>The program runs multiple trials and calculates the probability of a shared birthday occurring. It follows an approach using separate classes for simulations, experiments, trials, and birthdays. The program also allows for a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility of results, making it a controlled experiment in probability simulation. By analyzing these results, the project helps visualize how quickly the likelihood of a birthday match.</p>
              <p><strong>Project Design and Implementation</strong></p>
              <p>The Simulation.java class serves as the entry point, managing the execution flow and initializing the experiments. Experiment.java, runs multiple trials to calculate the probability of shared birthdays for different group sizes. The Trial.java class simulates an individual trial by randomly generating birthdays for a given number of people, while Birthday.java ensures that each birthday is valid and randomly assigned. The program uses a single instance of a random number generator, initialized in Simulation.java, allowing for a fixed seed to ensure reproducible results.</p>
              <p><strong>What Did I learn?</strong></p>
              <p>Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to implement test cases to verify the accuracy of the probability calculations and ensure that the program produced consistent results. Writing test cases highlighted the importance of edge cases, especially when working with randomly generated data. This project also emphasized the value of clean code practices, such as using clear method names, structuring classes logically, and avoiding redundant computations.</p>

              <h3>Elevator Simulator</h3>
              <p><strong>What is the Elevator Simulator?</strong></p>
              <p>The Elevator Simulator models the behavior of different types of elevators in a building, each with unique rules for accepting and completing elevator calls. The system includes a scheduler that assigns calls based on elevator capabilities, direction, and current location. The simulation runs round-by-round, providing a clear view of elevator activity and call statuses.</p>
              <p><strong>What Does This Project Do?</strong></p>
              <p>This simulator tracks elevator states—including floor, direction, number of passengers, and assigned calls. It does this while simulating each elevators logic for handling calls. Calls are scheduled using either a simple or complex scheduling algorithm. The simulator prints the full state of the system each round, and ends when all calls are completed and elevators return to the ground floor.</p> 
              <p><strong>Project Design and Implementation</strong></p>
              <p>The project was designed using object-oriented principles and SOLID design. Elevators are implemented as subclasses of an abstract elevator base class, with each type (Standard, Freight, Penthouse, Express) overriding behavior for accepting and completing calls. The scheduler (SimpleScheduler or ComplexScheduler) determines call assignments. Test driven development (TDD) was used at the beginning of this project, with unit tests validating elevator behavior.</p> 
              <p><strong>What Did I Learn?</strong></p>
              <p>Through this project, I practiced implementation starting with test driven development which was not an approach I was used to. I gained more experience with proper use of Github for team collaboration with branching, pull requests, and code reviews. I learned that I should create a new branch for each new feature, and learned a lot about patience, organization, and merging with a bigger project than I had experience with before. </p>

                <h3>Pizza Parlor Simulator</h3>
                <p><strong>What is the Pizza Parlor Simulator?</strong></p>
                <p>This project simulates a customizable pizza ordering system written in Java. It was built for an academic course on object-oriented programming and uses multiple design patterns to demonstrate good SOLID principles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What Does This Project Do?</strong></p>
                <p>The system allows users to select a pizza style (like New York, Chicago, Neapolitan, or Custom), customize toppings, and choose a payment method (cash or card). It validates inputs such as credit card information and supports multiple strategies for payment processing.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Project Design and Implementation</strong></p>
                <p>The project applies key design patterns including Strategy, Simple Factory, Factory Method, and Decorator. Payment methods are implemented using the Strategy pattern. Custom pizzas and toppings demonstrate the Decorator pattern. The project follows SOLID principles and emphasizes modular, testable code. Unit tests were written using JUnit for multiple edge cases including invalid card formats and toppings.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What Did I Learn?</strong></p>
                <p>This was the first large scale project I built entirely from scratch as part of a group of four. It was both a technical and collaborative learning experience that taught me the patience required to work in a shared repository with multiple contributors during a highly creative process. We managed code merges, divided responsibilities, and coordinated implementation decisions throughout development.</p>
                <p>One of the biggest lessons I learned was the importance of following test-driven development (TDD) from the beginning. Skipping test implementation early in the process led to complications when merging code and validating pullrequests. This experience showed me how TDD provides structure, confidence in code stability, and smoother collaboration.</p>
